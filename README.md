# Bank_Note_Authentication

This is an app that was developed to authenticate the Bank Note that whether it is real or fake.
This is a Machine Learning classification problem statement.
In this project, I used the RandomForest Classifier ML algorithm to build a model.
Then the model was saved in a pickle format and then loaded in Pycharm where a real-time Flasgger-based app was built.
Flask was used to build an API and Flasgger was responsible for Front-End web application.
